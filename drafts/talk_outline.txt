The Panoramix Decryption Mix Network Design:
low latency and reliable mix network protocol design

* One fancy image

* SLIDE 1 INTRODUCTION slide

   * Why would you need mixnets?
     give an example where mixnets are better than
     what first would come to the common mind
     
   * Why your specific mixnet solution rather than other solutions?

   * Context: Decentralized System

   * Examples of such Systems: Tor, Bitcoin, ... Operated by cooperative membership

   * Designed to be run by fixed closed group of operators rather than
     volunteer-run like Tor

   * Problem Statement: Traffic Analysis Problems from global passive adversaries

   Alice wishes to hide who she knows and with whom
   she communicates from passive network observers. PGP encrypted
   email and Signal messaging only hide the communication payload
   contents however all of the other metadata is leaked such as to
   whom the message is sent to and from whom, the message sizes and
   transmission times.

* SLIDE 2 Solution: Mix Networks.

   Mixnets can be used to achieve several kinds of location
   hiding properties, also referred to as "anonymity":
  
      * Sender Anonymity
      * Receiver Anonymity
      * Sender/Receiver Anonymity w/ respect to 3rd party observers

* SLIDE 3 Our mixnet has SPECIAL FEATURES!

   Real world deployments of mixnets have historically offered poor
   quality of service both in terms of high latency AND unreliability.

   Our mixnet has two special features:

    * reliability
    * low latency

   Our mixnet has a Loopix inspired design which uses the Poisson mix
   strategy along with decoy traffic to acheive low latency.

* SLIDE 4 An additional note about mixnet protocol reliability

   * A mix network is a lossy packet switching network made up of
     component mixes. Pior mixnet research has assumed that
     reliability would be achieved by the applications using the
     mix network. These statements are misleading at best and are not
     made for packet switching networks in general because unreliable
     packet switching network protocols are always used in concert
     with a variety of other protocols that achieve reliablity such as
     TCP. It is therefore more correct to say that mixnet reliability
     can be achieved in a higher protocol constructed using mixnet
     protocol components such as forward Sphinx packets, Single Use
     Reply Blocks etc. The mixnet user client application makes use of
     this reliability protocol. The mixnet reliability protocol is
     merely a building block for constructing network communication
     applications for mix networks.

* 5 mix network SYSTEM OVERVIEW

   Similar to the Loopix design...

   * mix network topology: stratified

   * network perimeter: Clients + Providers

   * network interior: multiple component mixes arranged in several
     layers of strata

   * decentralized system with closed group of mix and Provider operators

   * explain mixnet topology: have a figure here that shows an example

   * how providers work: authenticate clients at the edge

   * exemplary protocol run: show the general protocol and highlight
     the single steps

   * end to end protocol reliability introduction

   * Stop and Wait ARQ

* 6 Active Attacks and Defenses

   * n-1 attacks

   * compulsion attacks

   * active confirmation attacks against the ARQ scheme

   passive

   * end to end message correlation attacks

* FUTURE WORK

   * Post-Quantum Crypto all the things: All three crypto protocol
     layers can be made to use PQ crypto

   * Volunteer-run Mixnet, but there are other problems to answer
     first like how are the Directory Authorities supposed to measure
     volunteer mix packet-per-second capacity without getting gamed?
