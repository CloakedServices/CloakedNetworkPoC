Reunion Library
===============

Reunion is a cryptographic protocol allowing an asynchronous n-way
passphrase authenticated exchange facilitated by the Reunion
server. Compared to PANDA it's much better because it leaks less
metadata and resists precomputational attacks by the server.


Status
------

Work-in-progress.
